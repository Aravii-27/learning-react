# learning-react
This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning and practicing React.js. Here, I'll be documenting my progress, sharing code snippets, and possibly creating small projects to solidify my understanding of React concepts.

This repository contains two projects:[now]

1. ## Google Keep Clone(./google-keep-clone)
   Description: This project is a clone of Google Keep, a note-taking app. It was created using React and showcases the basic principles of building a modern web application.

2. ## My Portfolio(./my-portfolio)
   Description: This project is my personal portfolio website, built with React. It includes information about me, my skills, and projects I've worked on.

Feel free to explore each project's directory for more details.
